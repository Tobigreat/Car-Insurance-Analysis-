All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution, or country, but just a sample dataset to demonstrate capabilities and upskills in Excel.

## Problem Statement
1. Determine the highest amount of claims 
2. Identify the targeted market
3. Ascertain the top 10 car brands  from the coverage zone
4. Determine the average insurance claims from the car company 
5. Ascertain the percentage of parents that use cars.

## Skills
The set of skills were used for the optimization of the analysis, which were: 
1. Power Query
2. Pivot tables
3. Page navigation
4. Tables
5. Filters,
6. Slices and
7. charts

## Data source
The dataset was derived  from https://click.convertkitmail2.com/xmum9lxqnoa6hr97wpgb5h0m00zll/9qhzhdup3qzxmztz/aHR0cHM6Ly9vbnl4ZGF0YS5jby51ay9kYXRhLWRuYS1kYXRhc2V0LWNoYWxsZW5nZS8= 
## Data transformation 
Data was loaded into Excel to study the data pattern which was later further into power query for sorting and filtering and to ensure the data types to remove nulls, duplicates, and empty cells and to ensure the data was ready for use. 

## Modelling
There is no modelling that was carried out during the process.  

## Visualization 
Both chart and line graph were used to visualise the analysis and KPI metrics were used. 

## Analysis: 
The total number of respondents that were analyzed was 37542 from 78 car companies which were done in Excel using a pivot table.  The total household income is $5, 527, 962,182 while the claim amount  is $1,878,170,476.20. The result indicated that the single used more cars, Ford is the company that paid highest claims while Ford is the highest car used.  

## Conclusion and Recommendation 
It could be inferred that the highest claims were paid by Ford Motors ($165,583,317.03) while Ramble ($83,018.84) paid the lowest, one of the contributing factors might be the usage of cars. Furthermore, the highest purchased cars were Ford Motor which implies that most Ford motors are affordable. less than half of the parents (445%) were using cars. The singles have the highest number of car use followed by married. Over the years there is an increase in the number of claims ($110,221.68 to $97,397,487.54 and the highest number of claims was in 2006.

## Recommendation
From the study, the following were recommended: 
1. The company should make more cars for commercial purposes
2. To increase the revenue from car manufacture, organizations should focus more on single and married as their high-priority market in order to insure their cars  
3. Other brand should also make their cars to be available and affordable.
